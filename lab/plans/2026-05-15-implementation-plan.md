# Consortium — Implementation Plan

Status: active
Date: 2026-05-15

## Context

`consortium` is the early scaffolding of a Rust crate whose **primary** product is *evergreen, best-of-best `prompt → completion` datasets*. The pipeline:

1. Embed user-supplied prompts and select a maximally diverse subset (latent-space fencing) so the dataset covers the input distribution without redundancy.
2. For each selected prompt, generate completions across many LLM providers (multi-model fan-out).
3. Have multiple LLM judges source-blind rank the candidate completions; aggregate the rankings.
4. Emit the final `prompt → best-completion` corpus.

Secondary use case: the same machinery doubles as a "consortium" inference SDK for runtime calls (slower, costlier, higher quality). The crate also incidentally yields a normalized set of provider clients.

Provider modules: Claude / OpenAI / Gemini are real (M2a/b/c landed); Deepseek / Kimi / Qwen / Llama remain stubs commented out of `multi_infer` until M7. M0 added the dependency baseline (`tokio` full, `futures`, `reqwest` rustls-tls + json, `serde` derive, `serde_json`, `thiserror`, `bytes`; dev-deps `tokio-test`, `mockito`) and moved agnostic output types to owned payloads. M1 landed the async fan-out: `multi_infer` is `pub async fn(&MultiAiCompletionInputs<'_>) -> Vec<ProviderAttempt>` with typed `AgnosticCompletionError`, `ProviderKind`, and a local retry helper; each `ProviderAttempt` carries `input_index` so callers can correlate results back to specific input slots even when the same provider repeats. The public construction path is `MultiAiCompletionInputs::new(&[AiCompletionInputs::…])`, with active provider client / command / model / message / role types re-exported at the crate root. M2 landed real clients for all three target providers: each provider's `*Client` (with `new` / `from_env` / `with_base_url`), typed `*Model` enum, `*CompletionCommand`, mockito-tested wire path, and per-provider failure mapping into `AgnosticCompletionError`. The post-M2c extraction-checkpoint pass lifted `parse_retry_after`, the shared `WireErrorBody`, and the 401/403/429/4xx/5xx status-to-failure mapping into `src/ai_client_apis/shared.rs` via a small `FailureFromStatus` trait that each provider impls in four trivial methods. `AgnosticCompletionError::ProviderStub` was retired in that same commit. A subsequent stabilization pass swapped `api_key: String` for `secrecy::SecretString` across all three clients (Debug output now redacts automatically), replaced the bespoke exponential-backoff-with-splitmix-jitter retry helper with `backon`-driven backoff (`run_with_retry` / `RetryOutcome` / `delay_for_attempt` / `jitter_within` / `JITTER_COUNTER` all gone), and reshaped constructors to `new` / `new_with_base_url` / `from_env` / `from_env_with_base_url` so tests no longer rely on the awkward "allocate default base URL then overwrite" pattern. The boundary the next phase picks up at is M3 (embeddings + diversification).

**Decisions locked in via Q&A + plan review:**
- Initial provider depth: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini only. Deepseek/Kimi/Qwen/Llama stay as stubs until M7.
- Non-streaming completions first; streaming becomes an additive future capability.
- Embedding source is **pluggable from day one** via an `Embedder` trait (with at least one shipped impl).
- Diversification selection algorithm is configurable via a `SelectionStrategy` enum: `Centroid` (default, matches README) and `FarthestPointSampling`.
- Cross-provider boundary types are **owned**, not borrowed. The current lifetime-heavy `AgnosticCompletionOutput` scaffolding is allowed to change early; real output payloads should use `String` and `bytes::Bytes`/`Vec<u8>` so they survive async/network boundaries cleanly.
- Failure handling is explicit at three levels: provider-attempt failures are preserved in fan-out results, prompt-level failures are preserved in dataset builds, and only configuration / unrecoverable orchestration failures bubble as top-level `Result` errors. No silent dropping of failed attempts.
- The crate becomes **async-native** in M1. Public orchestration APIs become `async fn`s and require a caller-managed runtime; the library should not try to hide or own a Tokio runtime internally.
- M8 genericification is **generic-first**. Introduce `Provider` / `Embedder` traits for static dispatch first; add boxed/dynamic wrappers only later if runtime heterogeneity proves necessary.

## Phased Plan

### M0 — Foundation
- Keep `README.md` aligned with current project direction while preserving the lightweight navigation pattern used across repo docs.
- Keep `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the `lab/` indexes current as implementation decisions, experiments, and workflow expectations evolve.
- Add `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE` text files.
- Update `Cargo.toml` `[dependencies]`: `tokio` (full), `futures`, `reqwest` (rustls-tls, json), `serde` (derive), `serde_json`, `thiserror`, `bytes`. Dev-deps: `tokio-test`, `mockito`.
- Replace the borrowed/lifetime-parameterized agnostic output scaffolding in `src/lib.rs` with owned payload shapes before real provider work starts. The conceptual types stay, but `&str` / `&Vec<u8>` output fields should not survive into M2.

### M1 — Async Runtime + Error Types

Status: landed.

- `multi_infer` is `pub async fn` returning `Vec<ProviderAttempt>`. The library does not own a Tokio runtime; callers provide one (`#[tokio::test]`, `#[tokio::main]`, or a manually-built runtime).
- `ProviderKind { Claude, OpenAi, Gemini }` names the three M2-tier providers. Deepseek/Kimi/Qwen/Llama remain stubs through M7.
- `AgnosticCompletionError` (thiserror), every variant carrying `provider: ProviderKind`. Current contract (after M2 refinements and the post-M2c extraction pass):
  - `Transport { source: reqwest::Error }`
  - `Deserialize { source: serde_json::Error }`
  - `RateLimited { retry_after: Option<Duration>, message: Option<String> }`
  - `Auth { message: Option<String> }`
  - `InvalidRequest { message: String }`
  - `ServerError { status: u16, message: Option<String> }`
  - `MalformedResponse { reason: String }`

  Accessors: `provider()` and `is_transient()`. Transient = Transport / RateLimited / ServerError. (M1 introduced the variant set originally; M2 added `Auth.message`, `RateLimited.message`, and `MalformedResponse`. The M1-era `ProviderStub` placeholder was retired in the extraction-checkpoint commit once all three real providers were live.)
- `ProviderAttempt { provider, result, retries, latency, input_index }` with `result: Result<AgnosticCompletionOutput, AgnosticCompletionError>`. Per-provider failures stay inside `result` — never collapsed to a top-level fan-out error. `input_index` (added post-M1) lets callers correlate completion-order attempts back to original input slots.
- Fan-out is `FuturesUnordered<BoxFuture<'a, ProviderAttempt>>` across Claude/OpenAI/Gemini so the three concrete branch futures share one in-flight queue.
- Retry orchestration is folded directly into `build_attempt` and driven by `backon::ExponentialBuilder` for backoff computation. The hand-rolled `run_with_retry` / `delay_for_attempt` / `JITTER_COUNTER` / splitmix jitter machinery was removed during the stabilization pass after M2c. `MAX_RETRIES = 2` (1 initial + 2 retries) and `BASE_RETRY_DELAY = 100ms` are kept as named constants. The thin loop still special-cases `AgnosticCompletionError::RateLimited::retry_after` via a small `retry_after_override` helper (backon's `Backoff` trait does not expose the error to its delay computation, so this stayed as a hand-rolled branch). The `backoff.next()` iterator drives the retry budget regardless of which branch (override vs exponential) ends up sleeping, so the bounded-attempts contract holds.
- `convert_raw_result_to_agnostic_output` is crate-private and returns `Result<AgnosticCompletionOutput, AgnosticCompletionError>`. M2 filled in real per-provider Ok arms (text chunks + token counts); the seed-era empty-vec stubs are gone.
- **Verified during M1 (pre-extraction tests since superseded by M2 fan-out tests):** an `#[tokio::test]` constructed three stub inputs and asserted each produced exactly one `ProviderAttempt` with the matching provider id and a typed error. After M2c retired all stubs, that test was replaced by the M2-era fan-out success / duplicate-index / transient-retry tests in `src/lib.rs#tests`.

### M2 — Three Real Provider Clients

Sequenced as one provider at a time, validating the shape on the first before replicating it. Each provider lives under `src/ai_client_apis/<name>/mod.rs` and follows the same contract.

**Provider-wide conventions (landed during M2a/M2b).** Apply to every provider in M2 and beyond:

- Typed model enum (`OpenAiModel`, `ClaudeModel`, later `GeminiModel`) with `as_api_str`, `Display`, and `serde::Serialize`. `Custom(String)` variant for forward-compat. Public command structs must not expose raw model strings.
- Per-provider `*CompletionFailure` enum with: `Transport(reqwest::Error)`, `Deserialize(serde_json::Error)`, `Auth { message: Option<String> }`, `RateLimited { retry_after: Option<Duration>, message: Option<String> }`, `InvalidRequest { message: String }`, `ServerError { status: u16, message: Option<String> }`, `MalformedResponse { reason: String }`.
- 200-OK responses with missing/empty content blocks must surface as `MalformedResponse`, never empty-string success.
- Agnostic `AgnosticCompletionError` carries the same shape including `Auth.message`, `RateLimited.message`, and a top-level `MalformedResponse { provider, reason }` variant.

**M2a — OpenAI (seed): landed.** See [2026-05-15-openai-seed-shape](../journal/2026-05-15-openai-seed-shape.md) for the original shape and [2026-05-15-claude-seed-and-typed-models](../journal/2026-05-15-claude-seed-and-typed-models.md) for the contract refinements (typed model, MalformedResponse, message-context preservation) that landed with the Claude seed.

- `OpenAiClient` (`new` / `from_env` reading `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `with_base_url` builder).
- `OpenAiCompletionCommand { model: OpenAiModel, system_prompt: Option<String>, messages, max_tokens: Option<u32>, temperature: Option<f32> }` with `Default`.
- `OpenAiCompletionFailure` typed enum (full variant list above). Converted to `AgnosticCompletionError` via `openai_failure_to_agnostic` in `lib.rs`.
- `convert_raw_result_to_agnostic_output` OpenAI arm populates a text chunk and real token counts.
- Tests: success / 401 / 403 / 429-with-`Retry-After` / 400 / 503 / malformed-JSON / empty-choices-`MalformedResponse` / model-serialization / `multi_infer` fan-out success / `multi_infer` 503-driven retry verifying `ProviderAttempt.retries == 2`. Plus 1 `#[ignore]` live test on `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

`OpenAiModel` was subsequently narrowed (commit `b15a099`) to `{ Gpt4oMini, Gpt4o, Gpt4Turbo, Custom(String) }`. The o-series variants (`O1`, `O1Mini`, `O3Mini`) were dropped because OpenAI reasoning models require `max_completion_tokens` (not `max_tokens`) and `developer` role (not `system`); the current chat-completions wire path does not emit that shape. Adding o-series support is its own future slice with a branched request builder. `Custom` is documented as a chat-completions-shape-only escape hatch.

**M2b — Claude: landed.**

- `ClaudeClient` (`new` / `from_env` reading `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `with_base_url`). Auth via `x-api-key` header and required `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`.
- `ClaudeCompletionCommand { model: ClaudeModel, system_prompt: Option<String>, messages: Vec<ClaudeMessage>, max_tokens: u32, temperature: Option<f32> }` with `Default`. `max_tokens` is **required** at the type level because Anthropic's API rejects requests without it.
- `ClaudeModel { Opus47, Sonnet46, Haiku45, Custom(String) }`.
- Endpoint: `POST /v1/messages`. Response content is an array of typed content blocks; the seed parses and concatenates `text` blocks and surfaces `MalformedResponse` if no text is produced. Other block types (e.g., `tool_use`) are deserialized to a catch-all `Unknown` variant and dropped — handling them is M4+ work.
- `ClaudeCompletionFailure` typed enum (full variant list above). Converted via `claude_failure_to_agnostic`.
- Tests: success / multi-text-block concatenation / 401 / 429-with-`Retry-After` / 400 / 503 / 529 (Anthropic's "overloaded") / malformed-JSON / empty-content-`MalformedResponse` / model-serialization / `multi_infer` fan-out success. Plus 1 `#[ignore]` live test on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

**M2c — Gemini: landed.**

- `GeminiClient` (`new` / `from_env` reading `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `with_base_url`). Auth via `x-goog-api-key` header (the URL `?key=` query form is also supported by the API but the header path is cleaner for mocking and avoids the key surfacing in logs / URLs).
- `GeminiCompletionCommand { model: GeminiModel, system_prompt: Option<String>, messages: Vec<GeminiMessage>, max_tokens: Option<u32>, temperature: Option<f32> }` with `Default`. `max_tokens` stays `Option<u32>` because Google's API does not require it.
- `GeminiModel { Gemini20Flash, Gemini15Pro, Gemini15Flash, Custom(String) }`.
- `GeminiRole { User, Model }` — Gemini's API uses `model` rather than `assistant` for prior-turn replies, so the role enum exposes the API-native name.
- Endpoint: `POST {base_url}/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent`. The model id is part of the URL path, not the request body. The request body uses `contents` (Gemini's name for messages), a top-level `systemInstruction` field for the system prompt, and a nested `generationConfig` object for `maxOutputTokens` / `temperature`.
- Response: `candidates[].content.parts[]` where each part may carry `text`. The seed concatenates all text parts and surfaces `MalformedResponse` if candidates is empty or no text parts are present. Non-text parts (e.g., `inlineData`, `functionCall`) deserialize but their text field is `None` and they're filtered out.
- `GeminiCompletionFailure` typed enum (same variant list as OpenAI / Claude). Converted via `gemini_failure_to_agnostic`.
- Tests: success / multi-text-part concatenation / 401 / 429-with-`Retry-After` / 400 / 503 / malformed-JSON / empty-candidates-`MalformedResponse` / empty-text-parts-`MalformedResponse` / model-serialization / `multi_infer` fan-out success. Plus 1 `#[ignore]` live test on `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

**Extraction checkpoint: landed.** Shared utilities moved into `src/ai_client_apis/shared.rs` (`pub(crate)`):

- `parse_retry_after(&HeaderMap) -> Option<Duration>` — one definition, used by all three providers.
- `WireErrorBody { error: { message } }` — one definition, plus `parse_error_message(&Bytes) -> Option<String>` wrapping the parse.
- `FailureFromStatus` trait with four constructor methods (`auth`, `rate_limited`, `invalid_request`, `server_error`) and `map_status_to_failure<F: FailureFromStatus>(status, headers, bytes) -> F` doing the 401/403 → Auth, 429 → RateLimited (with `parse_retry_after`), 400..=499 → InvalidRequest, 500..=599 → ServerError, fallback → ServerError mapping. Each provider impls the trait in four trivial methods and the call site becomes a single `super::shared::map_status_to_failure(...)` line.
- `AgnosticCompletionError::ProviderStub` retired. `provider()` and `is_transient()` exhaustive matches updated.

Per-provider `*CompletionFailure` enums were kept as-is — the extraction was a pure refactor with no semantic redesign. Collapsing to a shared `ProviderFailure` enum was considered and deferred since it'd be a behavior-shape change, not a refactor.

Provider behavior, public API surface, and wire shape did not change. Test matrix stayed green at 34 passed + 3 ignored.

- **Verify per provider:** `mockito` parsing tests covering success, each typed failure variant, and the `MalformedResponse` empty-content edge; `#[ignore]`-gated integration tests that hit real APIs when keys are present (`cargo test -- --ignored`).

### M3 — Embedding + Diversification

**Direction change (recorded 2026-05-15):** the original M3 framing was "one `Embedder` trait with an `OpenAiEmbedder` reusing the OpenAI HTTP client." That single-provider seed is too forgiving — embedding abstractions calcify around the first provider's shape fast. M3 is reframed to land Cohere and OpenAI as first-class embedders together, so the agnostic boundary has to survive two providers with different model families, dimensions, and request shapes from day one. See [2026-05-15 — M3 Multi-Provider Embedding Direction](../journal/2026-05-15-m3-multi-provider-embedding.md).

**M3a — Embedding abstraction + Cohere seed + OpenAI seed + selection core.**

New modules:

- `src/embeddings/mod.rs` — agnostic boundary:
  - `pub trait Embedder { async fn embed(&self, inputs: &[String]) -> Result<EmbeddingBatch, AgnosticEmbeddingError>; }` (native async fn in trait; static dispatch only).
  - `pub enum EmbeddingProvider { Cohere, OpenAi }`.
  - `pub enum AgnosticEmbeddingError` (thiserror) — same variant set as `AgnosticCompletionError`: `Transport`, `Deserialize`, `Auth { message }`, `RateLimited { retry_after, message }`, `InvalidRequest { message }`, `ServerError { status, message }`, `MalformedResponse { reason }`. All variants carry `provider: EmbeddingProvider`.
  - `pub struct EmbeddingBatch { pub vectors: Vec<Vec<f32>>, pub usage: EmbeddingUsage }`.
  - `pub struct EmbeddingUsage { pub input_tokens: u64 }` (room to add `model_used`, `request_id`, etc. without breaking `EmbeddingBatch`).
  - Crate-private `cohere_embedding_failure_to_agnostic` and `openai_embedding_failure_to_agnostic` mappers (mirrors the completions pattern).
- `src/ai_client_apis/cohere/mod.rs` + `embeddings.rs` — `CohereEmbedder` with `new` / `new_with_base_url` / `from_env` (reads `COHERE_API_KEY`) / `from_env_with_base_url`, builder methods `with_model` / `with_input_type`. Typed `CohereEmbeddingModel { EmbedEnglishV3, EmbedMultilingualV3, EmbedEnglishLightV3, Custom(String) }` with `as_api_str` / `Display` / `Serialize`. Typed `CohereEmbeddingInputType { SearchDocument, SearchQuery, Classification, Clustering }` with `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")] Serialize`. `POST /v2/embed` with `Authorization: Bearer`. Request body `{model, input_type, texts, embedding_types: ["float"]}`. Response `{embeddings: {float: [[...]]}, meta: {billed_units: {input_tokens}}}`. `CohereEmbeddingFailure` typed enum impls `FailureFromStatus` so the shared status mapping in `src/ai_client_apis/shared.rs` is reused.
- `src/ai_client_apis/openai/embeddings.rs` — `OpenAiEmbedder` with the same four-constructor shape and `with_model` builder. Typed `OpenAiEmbeddingModel { TextEmbedding3Small, TextEmbedding3Large, TextEmbeddingAda002, Custom(String) }`. `POST /v1/embeddings` reusing the existing OpenAI bearer-auth pattern. Request `{model, input}`. Response `{data: [{embedding}], usage: {prompt_tokens}}`. `OpenAiEmbeddingFailure` impls `FailureFromStatus`.
- `src/diversification/mod.rs` — provider-agnostic selection over `&[Vec<f32>]`:
  - `pub enum SelectionStrategy { Centroid, FarthestPointSampling }`.
  - `pub struct StopCondition { pub max_n: Option<usize>, pub similarity_tripwire: Option<f32> }`.
  - `pub fn select_diverse(embeddings: &[Vec<f32>], strategy: SelectionStrategy, stop: StopCondition) -> Vec<usize>` returning indices into the input. Centroid: running-mean-then-pick-least-similar-to-mean. FPS: pick-farthest-from-nearest-already-selected.
  - Private `cosine_similarity` helper.

Defaults:

- Cohere: `embed-english-v3.0` + `search_document` input type. **Not** `embed-v4.0` (multimodal) — text embeddings only in M3a per direction change.
- OpenAI: `text-embedding-3-small`.

Batching: M3a originally shipped with one HTTP request per `embed` call and required callers to hand-shard before the per-provider per-request input limit (OpenAI: 2048, Cohere v3: 96). M6c folded auto-chunking inside the shipped concrete embedders themselves; the agnostic `Embedder` boundary is unchanged but the shipped `OpenAiEmbedder` / `CohereEmbedder` now transparently issue multiple HTTP requests when needed and concatenate per-chunk results in input order. See the M6c section below.

Tests:

- Provider-local `mockito` tests per embedder: success / auth / rate-limit-with-Retry-After / invalid-request / server-error / malformed-JSON / empty-embeddings-`MalformedResponse` / model-serialization. Plus one `#[ignore]` live test per provider gated on the respective env var.
- Provider-agnostic synthetic-2D selection tests: hand-built clusters at corners of a square; both `Centroid` and `FarthestPointSampling` strategies pick one representative per cluster when `max_n` matches the cluster count. Plus `max_n` and `similarity_tripwire` each tested in isolation.

**M3b (deferred, not in this slice).** Multimodal embedding support (Cohere `embed-v4.0` / OpenAI image-embedding endpoints if they emerge). Additional providers (Voyage, Mixedbread, etc.) as motivated. Embedding-side retry helper analogous to the completions path if real-world rate limits make it necessary. (Auto-chunking inside `Embedder::embed` was originally an M3b candidate; it landed under M6c instead — see the M6c section.)

### M4 — Judge Phase

**Direction corrections (recorded 2026-05-15 before coding):** the original M4 outline had a real architectural bug — `HashMap<BlindId, ProviderTag>` collapses candidates to provider identity, which doesn't survive M5 phase-1 where multiple candidates from the same provider get judged together. The plan is corrected to map blind ids to **candidate identity** (specifically: candidate index in the original slice), and to make the parse contract typed and strict from day one. See [2026-05-15 — M4 Judge Layer Corrections](../journal/2026-05-15-m4-judge-layer.md).

**M4a — Judge primitives (landed):** new module `src/judge/`.

- `Candidate { content, provider: ProviderKind, model: String }` — what callers assemble after fan-out. Provider/model stay with the candidate but are never sent to the judge.
- `BlindId(String)` — opaque, neutral, displays as `c1`, `c2`, etc.
- `BlindCandidate { id, content }` — what the judge actually sees.
- `assign_blind_ids(&[Candidate]) -> (Vec<BlindCandidate>, HashMap<BlindId, usize>)`. The `usize` is the candidate's index in the original slice, so the caller recovers full provenance — including which of two same-provider candidates was which — without leaking anything to the judge.
- `JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (`pub const`) locks the response shape: `<reasoning>...</reasoning>` then `<ranking>id1,id2,...</ranking>`. No ties. Every candidate exactly once. No text outside the blocks. Explicitly tells the judge it does not know the source model/provider. A test asserts the prompt does not mention any known provider name.
- `build_judge_user_message(&[BlindCandidate]) -> String` formats candidates using their blind ids only.
- `parse_ordered_judgement(raw, &HashSet<BlindId>) -> Result<OrderedJudgement, JudgementParseError>`. Tolerates whitespace around ids and inside the reasoning block. Strict on semantics: rejects missing tags, empty ranking, unknown ids, duplicate ids, and missing-from-expected ids. `OrderedJudgement` carries `ordered_ids`, `reasoning`, and `raw_response` (for audit).
- `judge_rank(candidates, invoke_judge)` — `invoke_judge: FnOnce(JudgeRequest) -> Future<Output = Result<String, AgnosticCompletionError>>`. The closure-injected provider call keeps the judge layer provider-agnostic; the caller wires whichever real provider (or mock) as the judge. Provider errors propagate as `JudgementError::Provider`; parse failures as `JudgementError::Parse`.
- `aggregate_rankings(&[OrderedJudgement]) -> AggregatedRanking { ordered_ids, scores }`. Borda count: i-th-place candidate in a length-N ranking earns `N - i` points; summed across judges; ordered by total desc. Tie-break: lexicographic on `BlindId` (deterministic; documented as `c10 < c2`).

Removed from `src/lib.rs` as part of this slice: the M0-era `ORDERED_JUDGEMENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` placeholder, `OrderedJudgementStructuredData`, `SortableJudgementProvider`, `AiCompletionCommand`, and `make_sortable_judgement_command`. All superseded by `src/judge/`.

- **Verified:** 19 unit tests covering blind-id assignment + provenance, prompt + user-message provider-neutrality, parse success / whitespace tolerance / each typed parse error, `judge_rank` happy path + provider-error + parse-error propagation, Borda aggregation single / unanimous / disagreeing / tied / empty.

### M5 — Two-Phase Consortium

**M5a — Single-prompt typed-outcome orchestrator: landed.** Lives in `src/orchestrator/mod.rs`; re-exported from the crate root. See [2026-05-15 — M5a Two-Phase Consortium Orchestrator](../journal/2026-05-15-m5a-two-phase-orchestrator.md).

- `consortium_completion(slots, judges) -> ConsortiumOutcome`. `ConsortiumSlot { input: AiCompletionInputs, model_label: String, samples: usize }` configures each model entry; `JudgeProvider` is a tiny orchestrator-level trait (`label`, `invoke -> BoxFuture<...>`) so the same judge can be called once per slot in Phase 1 and once in Phase 2 — the M4 `src/judge/` primitives stay closure-based and provider-agnostic.
- **Phase 1 (intra-model):** one mega `multi_infer` fan-out across every `(slot, sample)` pair, intentionally exercising M1's duplicate `input_index` support. Attempts are binned by slot, candidates are assembled from successful samples, blind ids are assigned, judges are invoked once per slot, Borda is aggregated, and the winner is resolved back to a slot-local `sample_index`.
- **Phase 2 (inter-model):** per-slot winners become cross-model candidates; blind ids and judges run the same way; the winner resolves back to a `model_index` in `phase_one`.
- **Singleton short-circuits:** a slot with one surviving sample, or a cross-model phase with one surviving slot, picks the trivial winner without invoking judges. Blind ids are still assigned up front so `judged` / `candidates` stay populated and the BlindId-resolution contract is uniform.
- **Failure preservation** is first-class at every layer: failed `ProviderAttempt`s stay in `ModelPhaseOutcome.samples`; failed judge calls (`JudgementError::Provider` and `JudgementError::Parse`) stay in `JudgeOutcome.result`; a slot with zero surviving samples reports `winner = None` with full `samples` retained; a model that fails entirely is absent from `CrossModelPhaseOutcome.candidates` but visible in `phase_one` with `winner = None`.
- **Explicit blind-id provenance** is exposed in the public outcome (post-review fix): `ModelPhaseOutcome.judged: Vec<JudgedSample { blind_id, sample_index, content }>` and `CrossModelCandidate { blind_id, model_index, provider, model_label, content }`. Any preserved `BlindId` from a `JudgeOutcome.result` or `AggregatedRanking` — winning or not — resolves back to a concrete sample / model slot without callers relying on hidden ordering conventions.
- **Verified:** mockito-mocked providers and closure-based test judges drive `cargo test --lib` to 99 passed / 0 failed / 5 ignored. Two new tests: a happy-path 2-slot × 2-sample × 2-judge run that verifies winners, aggregation, and traces a non-winning blind id from a judge result back through `judged` and `candidates`; and a partial-failure run that asserts failed provider attempts and a failing judge are both preserved (not collapsed) while the surviving slot still produces a winner.

**M5b (deferred, not in this slice).** Parallelize judge invocation across slots and across judges within a phase using `FuturesUnordered`. Currently judges run sequentially — the correctness contract is settled, but concurrency is a follow-up once the latency budget is real.

**M5c (deferred, not in this slice).** Streaming surface — likely `mpsc::Sender<PhaseEvent>` driven off the same orchestrator, emitting one event per finalized `ModelPhaseOutcome` plus the final `CrossModelPhaseOutcome`. The typed `ConsortiumOutcome` stays the canonical surface; streaming is an additive view onto it. The originally proposed `--ignored` end-to-end test against real APIs lives at this slice (the in-memory shape doesn't need it; the streaming wiring does).

**M5d (deferred, not in this slice).** Multi-prompt orchestration. `consortium_completion` is single-prompt; multi-prompt fan-out is M6 / DatasetBuilder territory, built on top of this primitive.

### M6 — Dataset Pipeline + JSONL Writer

**M6a — Dataset builder, builder/run split, sequential per-prompt stream, minimal JSONL projection: landed.** Lives in `src/dataset/mod.rs`; re-exported from the crate root. See [2026-05-15 — M6a Dataset Builder And JSONL Pipeline](../journal/2026-05-15-m6a-dataset-builder-and-jsonl-pipeline.md).

- `DatasetBuilder<E: Embedder>` is generic over the embedder (static dispatch — `Embedder` is not dyn-safe). Builder fields: `slot_templates`, `judges: Vec<Arc<dyn JudgeProvider>>`, `embedder`, `selection`, `stop_condition`. Defaults: `Centroid`, no `max_n`, no `similarity_tripwire`.
- **Prompt-to-slot planning boundary:** `SlotTemplate` is a per-provider enum carrying the client by value (`OpenAiClient` / `ClaudeClient` / `GeminiClient` — all `Clone`) and a planner closure `Arc<dyn Fn(&str) -> Result<XxxCompletionCommand, Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>> + Send + Sync>`. Per-prompt commands live only inside `process_prompt`; the builder never stores prompt-specific `AiCompletionInputs`. Constructors accept `Fn(&str) -> Result<Cmd, E> where E: Into<Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>>` so callers return `String`, `&'static str`, `Infallible`, or any `Error` impl without naming a crate-defined error alias.
- **Builder/run split:** `DatasetBuilder::build()` validates eagerly (`DatasetBuildError::{NoSlots, NoJudges, ZeroSamples { slot_index, model_label }}`) and returns `DatasetRun<E>`. `DatasetRun::execute(prompts) -> Result<impl Stream<Item = PromptOutcome>, DatasetRunError>` embeds + selects once, then yields a `futures::stream::unfold`-backed stream of one `PromptOutcome` per input prompt in **original `prompt_index` order**, including in-place `Skipped` entries.
- **Three-category failure split:** `DatasetBuildError` (fatal setup), `DatasetRunError::{Embedding, EmbeddingCountMismatch, EmbeddingDimensionMismatch}` (fatal one-shot at run start), `PromptRunError::SlotPlanning { slot_index, model_label, #[source] source: Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync> }` (per-prompt, surfaces inside `PromptOutcome::Failed`). A failing prompt never terminates the stream. `EmptyPrompts` is **not** a fatal error — empty input yields an empty stream and skips embedding entirely. The dimension-mismatch variant guards a real runtime hole: `select_diverse` is documented to panic on jagged inputs, so the dataset layer validates uniform dimensionality before handing off.
- **Skip-embedding fast path:** when `stop_condition.max_n.is_none() && stop_condition.similarity_tripwire.is_none()`, every prompt is selected and `embedder.embed` is never called. This is the default `StopCondition` produced by `DatasetBuilder::new`.
- **`DatasetRow` JSONL projection** is deliberately small for M6a: `{ prompt_index, prompt, status: Completed { winner: Option<{ model_label, provider, content }> } | Skipped { reason } | Failed { error } }`. The full `ConsortiumOutcome` is **not** serialized here. `write_jsonl<W: AsyncWrite, S: Stream<Item = PromptOutcome>>` writes one line + flushes per row so a tail / crash preserves finalized prompts.
- The stream is intentionally **not `Send`** in M6a: the M5a orchestrator captures `&dyn JudgeProvider` across `.await`, and the trait-object form does not pick up `Sync` from the supertrait, so the orchestrator's future is intrinsically non-`Send`. Sending the stream across tasks would require modifying the M5a `consortium_completion` signature, which is out of scope for this slice.
- **Verified:** `cargo test --lib` is 107 passed / 0 failed / 5 ignored (+8 over M5a's 99). Tests cover builder validation (3), happy-path 3-prompt 2-selected-1-skipped in-order stream with mockito-backed slots and a closure judge, failing-planner-then-continue with the `Into<Box<dyn Error>>` String path, the `write_jsonl` row projection across all three variants, the empty-prompt short-circuit verifying `PanicEmbedder` is never invoked, and a jagged-embedding-dimension regression that proves a mixed-dimension batch surfaces as `DatasetRunError::EmbeddingDimensionMismatch` instead of panicking through `select_diverse`.

**M6b — Bounded per-prompt parallelism: landed.** See [2026-05-16 — M6b Bounded Per-Prompt Parallelism](../journal/2026-05-16-m6b-bounded-per-prompt-parallelism.md).

- `DatasetBuilder::parallelism(n)` knob added; default `1` preserves the M6a sequential contract. `DatasetBuilder::build` rejects `0` eagerly as `DatasetBuildError::ZeroParallelism`. The public `DatasetRun::execute(...)` signature did not change.
- `DatasetRun::execute` now drives a bounded `futures::stream::FuturesUnordered` of `process_prompt` futures inside the same `stream::unfold` shell. Each in-flight future owns clones of `Arc<Vec<SlotTemplate>>` / `Arc<Vec<Arc<dyn JudgeProvider>>>` plus the moved-out prompt `String`, so it is `'static` and box-pinnable — and the per-run state stays single-task (no `tokio::spawn`, stream remains not-`Send`, consistent with the M5a orchestrator constraint).
- Original `prompt_index` order is preserved by a `BTreeMap<usize, PromptOutcome>` reorder buffer. The unfold body runs a fill→emit loop: schedule selected prompts up to `parallelism` in flight, then yield `next_to_emit` if it is buffered or skipped, otherwise `in_flight.next().await` and re-loop. Skipped prompts are *not* pre-scheduled — they wait in `prompts[i]` and emit synchronously at their slot. This keeps the reorder buffer bounded by `parallelism` even when most of the input is filtered out.
- Failure preservation unchanged: planner failures still surface inline as `PromptOutcome::Failed` and never terminate the stream.
- **Verified:** `cargo test --lib` is 111 passed / 0 failed / 5 ignored (+4 over M6a's 107). Four new tests: builder rejects `parallelism = 0`; in-order delivery when prompt 0's judge sleeps 200 ms while prompts 1 and 2 finish immediately (mockito body-matching + real-time `tokio::time::sleep`); bounded concurrency via a custom `JudgeProvider` that pins each invocation at a shared `tokio::sync::Barrier(parallelism)` and asserts `max_seen == parallelism` (with an outer `tokio::time::timeout` to surface deadlocks as clean failures); partial-failure-under-concurrency interleaving two failing planners and three successes at `parallelism = 3`.

**M6c — Auto-chunking inside the shipped embedders: landed.** See [2026-05-16 — M6c Embedder Auto-Chunking](../journal/2026-05-16-m6c-embedder-auto-chunking.md).

- Public agnostic embedding boundary unchanged. `Embedder::embed(&[String])` keeps its signature; its doc updated to note that shipped impls auto-chunk while custom impls remain free to issue a single request.
- Each shipped embedder gains a crate-private `const MAX_INPUTS_PER_REQUEST` (`2048` for OpenAI's `/v1/embeddings`, `96` for Cohere v3's `/v2/embed`) and a tiny chunking shell `*_embed_raw` that calls an unchanged `*_embed_chunk` helper per chunk. The single-chunk path (which includes the empty-input case) calls the chunk helper directly with the original slice, so the common case allocates nothing extra. The over-limit path pre-allocates `Vec::with_capacity(inputs.len())` once and extends from each chunk's owned `EmbeddingBatch`.
- Per-chunk `EmbeddingUsage.input_tokens` are aggregated via `saturating_add` into one returned [`EmbeddingUsage`].
- Sequential per-chunk execution. A failing chunk short-circuits with its typed `*EmbeddingFailure` mapped through the existing `*_failure_to_agnostic` shim — no partial-success surface, no in-flight chunks to discard.
- **Verified:** `cargo test --lib` is 115 passed / 0 failed / 5 ignored (+4 over M6b's 111). Four new tests: per-provider over-limit success (asserts exact `vectors[i] = [i as f32, 0.0]` ordering across the chunk boundary and aggregated `EmbeddingUsage`) and per-provider later-chunk failure (asserts the typed `AgnosticEmbeddingError` from chunk 1 surfaces verbatim, no partial batch returned). Chunk routing under `mockito` uses unique-marker substrings on each chunk's first input plus `Matcher::Regex`. Pre-existing 33 clippy warnings unchanged (M7 stubs + one `collapsible_if` in `diversification`, both pre-flagged as out of scope).
- **M6c (deferred follow-ups).** Multimodal Cohere `embed-v4.0` would need its own per-request limit and a separate chunking path. Provider-side hardening to map mixed-dimension responses as `MalformedResponse` earlier (so the dataset layer never has to see them, per the M6a post-review note) still pending.

### M7 — Remaining Four Providers

Replicate M2 for Deepseek, Kimi K2, Qwen, Llama. Uncomment the corresponding arms in `AiCompletionInputs`/`RawAiCompletionResult` (`src/lib.rs:13-16`, `:28-31`) and the match arms in `multi_infer` (`src/lib.rs:103-114`).

### M8 — Genericify

- Lift the seven concrete `*Client` / `*CompletionCommand` / `*Result` types behind a generic-first `Provider` trait with associated types. Prefer static dispatch in the first pass; if callers later need runtime-pluggable heterogeneous providers, add boxed adapters as a follow-up instead of forcing trait-object design here.
- Parameterize the judge system prompt.
- Add a second `Embedder` impl (e.g., `fastembed` local) to validate the trait abstraction under a real second implementer.

### M9 — Language Bindings

- New crates in a workspace layout: `bindings/napi/` (TS via napi-rs) and `bindings/pyo3/` (Python).
- Expose a minimal surface: `build_dataset(prompts, config) -> Stream<Row>` and `consortium_complete(prompt, config) -> Completion`.

### M10 — Polish

- Progress events on a dedicated channel (per-prompt status: embedded, sampling, judging, finalized).
- Telemetry / metrics hooks (timings, retry counts, token totals); refine `CompletionOutputTokensUsed` per `src/lib.rs:46` TODO once provider reporting is well-understood.
- `examples/` directory: one dataset-generation example, one runtime-inference example.
- CI: build, `clippy -D warnings`, test, fmt check.
- Perf benchmarks against a fixture prompt set.

## Critical Files To Modify

- `src/lib.rs` — primary orchestrator; current `multi_infer`, `consortium_completion`, judge scaffolding all live here. Will be split into submodules as it grows past ~300 lines.
- `src/ai_client_apis/{claude,openai,gemini}/mod.rs` — filled in M2.
- `src/ai_client_apis/{deepseek,kimik2,qwen,llama}/mod.rs` — filled in M7.
- `Cargo.toml` — dependencies added in M0.
- `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` — root documentation and contributor contract.
- `lab/README.md`, `lab/plans/`, `lab/journal/`, `lab/decisions/` — working-note system and indexes.
- New: `src/diversification/`, `src/judge/`, `src/dataset/`.
- New: `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE`.

## Reuse Opportunities

The current `src/lib.rs` scaffolding is valuable as a concept map, but **not every concrete type shape is frozen**:

- `AgnosticCompletionOutput`, `CompletionOutputChunk`, `CompletionOutputImage`, `CompletionOutputTokensUsed` (`src/lib.rs:35-56`) stay conceptually, but their fields should become owned and their lifetime parameters are expected to disappear.
- `RawAiCompletionResult`, `AiCompletionInputs`, `MultiAiCompletionInputs` (`src/lib.rs:9-32`) are useful early fan-out scaffolding through M2/M7, but may be split or replaced once M8 introduces trait-based provider abstractions.
- `OrderedJudgementStructuredData`, `SortableJudgementProvider`, `AiCompletionCommand`, `make_sortable_judgement_command` (`src/lib.rs:175-205`) capture the right judge-layer concepts and should be filled in, even if they move into `src/judge/`.
- Per-provider stub modules remain good starting points because they already impose a uniform shape; M2 establishes the fill-in pattern, M7 replicates it mechanically.

## Verification

- **After M2:** `cargo test --lib` passes. With keys in env, `cargo test -- --ignored` round-trips all three flagship providers.
- **After M3:** synthetic-2D selection tests pass; visually plot picked indices to confirm latent-space fencing.
- **After M5:** `--ignored` consortium test produces a coherent best-of-best completion for a fixture prompt.
- **After M6:** `cargo run --example build_dataset` with a ~20-prompt fixture produces a JSONL corpus where diverse-prompt subset visibly spans the input set.
- **After M9:** example TS and Python scripts import their respective bindings and produce a row.

## Open Follow-Ups

- The README currently describes the centroid-style selection idea more directly than the `SelectionStrategy` surface the crate will eventually expose. Once FPS and related abstractions settle, update the README without losing its concise top-level framing.
- `CompletionOutputTokensUsed` breakdown (`src/lib.rs:46` TODO): refine to capture reasoning/cache/system splits once we know what each provider actually reports.
